## Release

This project isn't fully finished right now, I need to train a lot more the AI. I'll let you know...

## Overview
This repository provides an advanced solution for solving Google's reCAPTCHA v2/v3. The system is designed for developers who need to bypass reCAPTCHA and BotGuard challenges in an automated, reliable, and efficient manner.

The solver works by mimicking real user interactions with reCAPTCHA services, bypassing security mechanisms using server-side requests and reverse-engineering techniques. This tool is particularly useful for automating tasks in environments where CAPTCHA protection is present, such as form submissions, web scraping, and automated testing.

⚠️ **Important:** This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Ensure that you comply with Google's Terms of Service and applicable laws before using it in any production or commercial environment.
